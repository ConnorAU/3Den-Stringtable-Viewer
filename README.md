With over 27,000 strings avaliable in over 13 languages. (That's over 350,000 different varients!) 3Den Stringtable Viewer allows creators of missions or mods to use alreay localized text in their projects.
Specific lines of text will not be avaliable but simple text such as,
- Yes/No
- Unit names (e.g "Rifleman", etc.)
- Directions (e.g "North", "East", etc.)
- Menu UI text (e.g "Open", "Close", etc.)

#### If you run into any issues let me know and I'll try to get them fixed ASAP.
